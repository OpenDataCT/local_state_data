This is a list of items provided by Nancy Von Meyer which is quite helpful. Currently evaluating how ubiquitous this is accross all states
and whether they are done trhough formal programs.

Data Sharing Among Levels of Government

The exchange and passing of data varies greatly form state-to-state and county-to-county.  For example in some states, the real estate assessment or valuation or equalization processes are managed by the state and in others it is managed by local governments and passed to the county and then the state.  This is an assembly of possible data transfers.  Therefore there are some duplicate listings. Financial arrangements, such as highway funding, block grants, or school grants are not included in this list.
